👍 Here’s a **short history of JavaScript**:

1. **1995 – Birth**

   * Created by **Brendan Eich** at Netscape in just **10 days**.
   * First called **Mocha**, then renamed **LiveScript**, and finally **JavaScript** (marketing move to ride on Java’s popularity).

2. **1996 – Microsoft enters**

   * Microsoft made its own version called **JScript** for Internet Explorer.
   * This caused big **compatibility issues** (browser wars).

3. **1997 – Standardization**

   * JavaScript was standardized by **ECMA International** as **ECMAScript (ES)**.
   * ECMAScript 1 → the first official version.

4. **2009 – Modern JavaScript**

   * **ECMAScript 5 (ES5)** introduced → JSON, `Array.map`, `forEach`, strict mode.
   * Big step toward modern web apps.

5. **2015 – ES6 (Game Changer)**

   * Added `let`, `const`, `arrow functions`, `classes`, `modules`, promises, template literals.
   * This version made JavaScript a serious programming language for large applications.

6. **2015+ – Yearly Updates**

   * New features released **every year** (ES7, ES8, … ES2023).
   * Added async/await, spread operator, optional chaining, etc.

7. **Today**

   * Runs in **browsers** + **servers (Node.js)** + **mobile (React Native)** + **desktop apps (Electron)**.
   * Most popular language for **web development** and beyond.

👉 In short:
JavaScript started as a **small browser scripting tool** in 1995 and has grown into the **world’s most widely used programming language** powering the modern web.
